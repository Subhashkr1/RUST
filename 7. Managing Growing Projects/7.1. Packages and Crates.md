# Packages and Crates

## Crates
- A **crate** is the smallest unit of code compiled by Rust.
- Can be **binary** (executable) or **library** (shared functionality).
- **Binary crates** have a `main` function.
- **Library crates** provide reusable code.
- The **crate root** is the entry file for compilation.

## Packages
- A **package** is a collection of one or more crates.
- Contains a `Cargo.toml` file defining dependencies and build instructions.
- Can have multiple **binary crates** but only one **library crate**.

## Creating a Package
```sh
$ cargo new my-project
```
- Generates a `Cargo.toml` file and a `src/` directory.
- `src/main.rs` → Root of a binary crate.
- `src/lib.rs` → Root of a library crate (if present).
- Multiple binaries → Place them in `src/bin/`.
