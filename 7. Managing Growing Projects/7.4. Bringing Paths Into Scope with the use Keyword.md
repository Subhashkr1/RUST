# Bringing Paths into Scope with the `use` Keyword

Writing out full paths repeatedly can be inconvenient. The `use` keyword allows us to create shortcuts, improving readability and maintainability.

## Example Usage

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Here, `use crate::front_of_house::hosting;` allows us to call `hosting::add_to_waitlist()` instead of writing the full path.

## Scope Considerations

`use` statements apply only within the scope they are declared in. For example, the following does not compile:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist(); // Error: hosting not in scope
    }
}
```

To fix this, move `use` inside `customer` or reference the parent module with `super::hosting`.

## Idiomatic Use

Instead of importing a function directly, it is idiomatic to import its module:

```rust
use crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist; // Unidiomatic
use crate::front_of_house::hosting; // Preferred
```

For structs and enums, the full path is preferred:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
```

## Handling Name Conflicts

When two items share the same name, use aliases:

```rust
use std::fmt::Result;
use std::io::Result as IoResult;
```

## Re-exporting with `pub use`

To expose a module publicly:

```rust
pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;
```

This allows external code to use `restaurant::hosting::add_to_waitlist()`.

## Nested Paths

Reduce multiple `use` statements:

```rust
use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
```

or

```rust
use std::io::{self, Write};
```

## The Glob Operator

To bring all public items into scope:

```rust
use std::collections::*;
```

Use with caution, as it can obscure where names originate.
