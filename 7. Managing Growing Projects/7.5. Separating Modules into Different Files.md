# Separating Modules into Different Files

When Rust modules grow large, it's best to move their definitions to separate files for better organization.

## Extracting `front_of_house` Module

Modify `src/lib.rs`:

```rust
mod front_of_house;

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Create `src/front_of_house.rs`:

```rust
pub mod hosting {
    pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
}
```

## Extracting `hosting` Module

Modify `src/front_of_house.rs`:

```rust
pub mod hosting;
```

Create `src/front_of_house/hosting.rs`:

```rust
pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
```

## Alternate File Paths

Rust supports two styles:

- Modern: `src/front_of_house.rs`
- Older: `src/front_of_house/mod.rs`

For submodules:

- Modern: `src/front_of_house/hosting.rs`
- Older: `src/front_of_house/hosting/mod.rs`

Using both styles together will cause a compiler error.

## Summary

- Rust allows organizing code into modules across multiple files.
- Use `mod` to declare modules and place their code in corresponding files.
- Use `pub use` to re-export items for easy access.
- Follow modern file structure conventions for clarity.

This technique improves maintainability as projects grow.
