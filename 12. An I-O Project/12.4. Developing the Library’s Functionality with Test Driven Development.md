# Developing the Libraryâ€™s Functionality with TDD

## Introduction
To ensure a modular and testable design, we separate logic into `src/lib.rs` and keep argument parsing and error handling in `src/main.rs`. This allows us to test functions directly without executing the binary.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach
1. Write a failing test.
2. Implement minimal code to pass the test.
3. Refactor while keeping tests green.
4. Repeat the cycle for new functionality.

TDD maintains high test coverage and improves design quality.

## Writing a Failing Test
We add a test module in `src/lib.rs`:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn one_result() {
        let query = "duct";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.";
        
        assert_eq!(vec!["safe, fast, productive."], search(query, contents));
    }
}
```
Since `search` is not implemented, the test fails initially.

## Implementing the `search` Function
1. Define an empty `search` function returning an empty vector.
2. Iterate through lines using `.lines()`.
3. Check for query matches with `.contains(query)`.
4. Store matching lines in a `Vec<&str>`.

Final implementation:
```rust
pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    let mut results = Vec::new();
    
    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }
    
    results
}
```

## Integrating `search` in `run`
Modify `run` to utilize `search`:
```rust
pub fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(config.file_path)?;
    
    for line in search(&config.query, &contents) {
        println!("{line}");
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Running the Program
Example queries:
```sh
$ cargo run -- frog poem.txt
How public, like a frog

$ cargo run -- body poem.txt
I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
```

## Conclusion
We have successfully developed a `grep`-like program using TDD, covering file I/O, lifetimes, testing, and command-line parsing. Further optimizations can be made using iterators, which will be explored in Chapter 13.
