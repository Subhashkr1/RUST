# Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings

## Overview
Rust strings can be complex due to error handling, UTF-8 encoding, and how they are stored in memory. Strings are collections of bytes with methods for text manipulation.

## String Types
- **&str**: String slice, borrowed, immutable.
- **String**: Owned, mutable, growable UTF-8 encoded text.

## Creating Strings
```rust
let mut s = String::new();
let s = "initial contents".to_string();
let s = String::from("initial contents");
```

Supports UTF-8:
```rust
let hello = String::from("こんにちは");
```

## Updating Strings
- **Appending**:
  ```rust
  let mut s = String::from("foo");
  s.push_str("bar");
  s.push('l');
  ```
- **Concatenation**:
  ```rust
  let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
  let s2 = String::from("world!");
  let s3 = s1 + &s2; // s1 is moved
  ```
- **Using `format!`** (preserves ownership):
  ```rust
  let s = format!("{}-{}-{}", "tic", "tac", "toe");
  ```

## Indexing & Slicing
Rust does not allow direct indexing (`s[0]`) due to UTF-8 complexities. Instead, use slicing cautiously:
```rust
let hello = "Здравствуйте";
let s = &hello[0..4]; // "Зд"
```

## Iteration
- **By characters**:
  ```rust
  for c in "Зд".chars() { println!("{c}"); }
  ```
- **By bytes**:
  ```rust
  for b in "Зд".bytes() { println!("{b}"); }
  ```

## Conclusion
Strings in Rust are complex but offer safety and flexibility with explicit handling of UTF-8 data.
