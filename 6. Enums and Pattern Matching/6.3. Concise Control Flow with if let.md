# Concise Control Flow with if let

The `if let` syntax allows combining `if` and `let` to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring others.

### Example using `match`
```rust
let config_max = Some(3u8);
match config_max {
    Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}"),
    _ => (),
}
```
*This requires a boilerplate `_ => ()` to handle non-matching cases.*

### Equivalent code using `if let`
```rust
let config_max = Some(3u8);
if let Some(max) = config_max {
    println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}");
}
```
*This is more concise and avoids unnecessary indentation.*

### Using `if let` with `else`
```rust
let mut count = 0;
if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
    println!("State quarter from {state:?}!");
} else {
    count += 1;
}
```
*This behaves like `match`, but is more concise when only handling one pattern.*

### Summary
- `if let` is syntax sugar for `match` when handling a single pattern.
- It reduces verbosity and indentation.
- Unlike `match`, it does not enforce exhaustive checking.
- Use `if let` for simplicity and `match` for comprehensive pattern handling.

Rust's powerful enums and pattern matching allow for safe and expressive control flow!
