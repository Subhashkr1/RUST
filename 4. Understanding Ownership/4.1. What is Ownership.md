# Ownership in Rust

Rust’s **ownership system** is its most unique feature, ensuring **memory safety** without requiring a garbage collector. This system enables efficient memory management while preventing common programming errors like double frees and dangling pointers.

## Why Ownership Matters

Most programming languages handle memory in one of three ways:  
- **Garbage Collection (GC)**: The system automatically tracks and cleans up unused memory (e.g., Java, Python).  
- **Manual Memory Management**: The programmer explicitly allocates and deallocates memory (e.g., C, C++).  
- **Ownership Model (Rust)**: Memory is automatically managed by strict compile-time rules, eliminating the need for GC or manual deallocation.

## The Stack vs. The Heap

Understanding how memory is managed helps in understanding ownership:

| **Stack** | **Heap** |
|-----------|---------|
| Stores values with a **known, fixed size** at compile time. | Stores values with an **unknown or dynamic size**. |
| Fast and efficient: operates in **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)** order. | Slower, as it requires finding free memory and managing pointers. |
| Memory is automatically cleaned up when a function exits. | Memory must be explicitly freed or tracked. |

### Example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5; // Stored on the stack
    let y = String::from("Hello"); // Stored on the heap
}
```
- `x` is stored on the **stack** because it has a fixed size (`i32`).
- `y` is stored on the **heap** because `String` has an unknown size at compile time.

## Ownership Rules

Rust enforces **three ownership rules**:

1. **Each value in Rust has a single owner.**
2. **A value is dropped when its owner goes out of scope.**
3. **Ownership can be transferred, but there can only be one owner at a time.**

### Example of Scope and Ownership
```rust
fn main() {
    {                      // x is not valid here
        let x = 5;         // x is valid from this point
        println!("{}", x); // x is used
    }                      // x is dropped here
}
```
- `x` is **created** inside the block `{}`.
- It is **valid** within the block.
- Once the block ends, `x` is **dropped** and cannot be accessed.

---

## Move Semantics: Transferring Ownership

Unlike languages that copy references by default, Rust **moves** ownership unless specified otherwise.

### Example of Moving Ownership:
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;  // Ownership of `s1` moves to `s2`
    // println!("{}", s1); // ❌ Error! `s1` is no longer valid.
}
```
- Here, `s1` is moved to `s2`, so `s1` is **no longer accessible** after the assignment.

---

## Clone: Explicitly Copying Data

To **copy** data instead of moving it, use `.clone()`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone(); // Creates a new copy in the heap
    println!("{}, {}", s1, s2); // ✅ Both are valid
}
```
- `clone()` performs a **deep copy**, meaning new heap memory is allocated.

---

## Copy Trait: Stack-Based Copying

For simple **fixed-size** types (like integers), Rust automatically copies values instead of moving them.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = x; // `x` is copied, not moved
    println!("{}, {}", x, y); // ✅ Both are valid
}
```
Rust implements the **Copy trait** for:
- Integers (`i32`, `u64`, etc.)
- Floating-point numbers (`f64`)
- Booleans (`true`, `false`)
- Characters (`char`)
- Tuples (if all elements are `Copy`)

---

## Ownership in Function Calls

### Moving Ownership in Functions
When a variable is passed into a function, ownership is **transferred**:
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    takes_ownership(s); // Ownership moves
    // println!("{}", s); // ❌ Error! `s` is no longer valid.
}

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) {
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // `some_string` is dropped here
```

### Returning Ownership
Ownership can be returned explicitly:
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();
    let s2 = String::from("hello");
    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);
}

fn gives_ownership() -> String {
    let some_string = String::from("hello");
    some_string // Ownership is returned
}

fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String {
    a_string // Ownership is returned
}
```

---

## Borrowing & References

To avoid ownership transfers, Rust allows **borrowing** via **references** (`&`).

### Immutable Borrowing
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s); // Borrowing `s`
    println!("Length: {}", len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len() // Read-only access
} // Reference is dropped here
```
- `s` is **borrowed**, not moved.
- Multiple **immutable references** are allowed.

### Mutable Borrowing
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s);
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world!");
}
```
- Only **one mutable reference** is allowed at a time.

## Summary of Ownership Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Rust ensures memory safety by enforcing a single owner per value. |
| **Move Semantics** | Assigning a variable moves ownership instead of copying it. |
| **Clone** | Explicitly copies data using `.clone()`. |
| **Copy Trait** | Stack-allocated data types (`i32`, `bool`, etc.) are copied automatically. |
| **Borrowing (`&T`)** | Allows temporary, non-owning references. |
| **Mutable Borrowing (`&mut T`)** | Allows modification of borrowed data, but only one at a time. |
