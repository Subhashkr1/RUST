# References and Borrowing

## Issue with Ownership in Functions

When passing a variable to a function, ownership is transferred. To retain access, we can use references instead.

## Using References

A reference allows us to refer to a value without taking ownership.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

### Explanation:
- `&s1` creates a reference to `s1`.
- The function parameter is `&String`, meaning it borrows the value but does not own it.
- The reference prevents `s1` from being dropped after the function call.

## Immutable References

References are immutable by default. Attempting to modify a borrowed value results in an error.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world"); // Error!
}
```

## Mutable References

To modify a borrowed value, use **mutable references**.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

### Rules:
1. **Only one mutable reference** to a value at a time.
2. **No immutable references** can exist while a mutable reference exists.

## Avoiding Data Races

Rust enforces borrowing rules to prevent **data races**:
- No simultaneous mutable references.
- No mutable references while immutable references exist.

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s; // Error!
```

To fix, limit the scope of references:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
{
    let r1 = &mut s;
} // r1 goes out of scope here
let r2 = &mut s; // Now allowed
```

## Dangling References

Rust prevents dangling references (pointing to invalid memory locations):

```rust
fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    &s // Error! `s` is dropped at the end of the function
}
```

To fix, return an owned value instead:

```rust
fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    s // Ownership is moved
}
```

Rustâ€™s borrowing system ensures memory safety at compile time, preventing runtime errors related to invalid memory access.
