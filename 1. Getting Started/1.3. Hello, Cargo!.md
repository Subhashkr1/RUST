- `target/` â†’ Stores compiled binaries.

## Building and Running
```sh
cargo build      # Compile project
cargo run        # Compile & run
cargo check      # Check code without compiling
```

## Release Build
```sh
cargo build --release  # Optimized build
```

## Summary
- `cargo new` â†’ Create a new project.
- `cargo build` â†’ Compile project.
- `cargo run` â†’ Build and run in one step.
