# Unsafe Rust - Chapter 19.1

Rust is designed to be a memory-safe and thread-safe language. However, there are times when low-level operations are necessary, and Rust provides the `unsafe` keyword to bypass some of its safety guarantees.

## Why Use Unsafe Rust?
Unsafe Rust allows you to:
- Dereference raw pointers
- Call unsafe functions or methods
- Access or modify mutable static variables
- Implement unsafe traits
- Use `extern` functions for FFI (Foreign Function Interface)

These operations are necessary when interacting with hardware, optimizing performance, or integrating with low-level system components.

## 1. Dereferencing Raw Pointers

In safe Rust, references are always checked at compile time. Unsafe Rust allows raw pointers, which can:
- Be null or dangling
- Mutably alias (two mutable references to the same data)
- Not be automatically checked for safety

### Example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 42;
    let r1 = &x as *const i32; // Immutable raw pointer
    let r2 = &x as *mut i32;   // Mutable raw pointer

    unsafe {
        println!("r1 points to: {}", *r1);
        println!("r2 points to: {}", *r2);
    }
}
```

**Note:**
- Raw pointers do not have Rustâ€™s ownership rules.
- Dereferencing them requires an `unsafe` block.

---

## 2. Calling Unsafe Functions or Methods

Rust prevents calling unsafe functions directly unless wrapped in an `unsafe` block.

### Example:
```rust
unsafe fn dangerous_function() {
    println!("This function is unsafe!");
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        dangerous_function();
    }
}
```

---

## 3. Mutable Static Variables

Rust ensures safety by not allowing mutable global variables in safe code. However, using `unsafe`, mutable static variables can be accessed.

### Example:
```rust
static mut COUNTER: u32 = 0;

fn increment() {
    unsafe {
        COUNTER += 1;
    }
}

fn main() {
    increment();
    unsafe {
        println!("Counter: {}", COUNTER);
    }
}
```

**Warning:** Mutable static variables can lead to data races in multi-threaded environments.

---

## 4. Implementing Unsafe Traits

Traits can be marked as `unsafe` when they require the implementer to uphold additional guarantees.

### Example:
```rust
unsafe trait MyUnsafeTrait {
    fn dangerous_method(&self);
}

struct MyType;

unsafe impl MyUnsafeTrait for MyType {
    fn dangerous_method(&self) {
        println!("Executing unsafe trait method!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let obj = MyType;
    unsafe {
        obj.dangerous_method();
    }
}
```

---

## 5. Using `extern` Functions for FFI

`extern` is used for interfacing with external (non-Rust) code, such as C libraries.

### Example:
```rust
extern "C" {
    fn abs(input: i32) -> i32;
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        println!("Absolute value of -3: {}", abs(-3));
    }
}
```

**Key points:**
- The `extern "C"` block is used for C ABI compatibility.
- Calling an external function requires an `unsafe` block.

---

## Summary

Unsafe Rust provides the ability to perform low-level operations that are otherwise restricted. However, it should be used cautiously to avoid introducing memory unsafety. The five key features of unsafe Rust are:

1. **Dereferencing raw pointers**
2. **Calling unsafe functions or methods**
3. **Accessing or modifying mutable static variables**
4. **Implementing unsafe traits**
5. **Using `extern` functions for FFI**

Always prefer safe Rust when possible and limit the use of `unsafe` to well-audited and necessary cases.
