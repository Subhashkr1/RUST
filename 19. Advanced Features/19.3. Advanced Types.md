# Advanced Types in Rust

## 1. Type Aliases

Type aliases provide a way to create a shorthand for long or complex types.

### Example:
```rust
 type Kilometers = i32;

 let x: Kilometers = 10;
 let y: i32 = 20;

 println!("{}", x + y); // Works since Kilometers is just an alias for i32
```

- `Kilometers` is treated as `i32`, making code more readable without introducing new types.

## 2. The `!` (Never) Type

The never type `!` represents computations that never return.

### Example:
```rust
fn foo() -> ! {
    panic!("This function never returns");
}
```

- Functions returning `!` indicate infinite loops or fatal errors.

## 3. Dynamically Sized Types (DSTs) and the `Sized` Trait

Some types, like `str` and `trait` objects, do not have a fixed size at compile time.

### Example:
```rust
fn generic<T: ?Sized>(t: &T) {
    // ?Sized allows passing dynamically sized types
}
```

- `?Sized` relaxes the default `Sized` requirement for generics, allowing DSTs like `str`.

## 4. `newtype` Pattern for Type Safety

Newtype is a pattern where we wrap a primitive type in a struct to create a distinct type.

### Example:
```rust
struct Age(i32);

fn is_adult(age: Age) -> bool {
    age.0 >= 18
}
```

- Prevents accidental misuse of `i32` in contexts expecting an `Age` type.

## 5. Type Aliases for Trait Objects

You can use type aliases to simplify complex trait object definitions.

### Example:
```rust
type Thunk = Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static>;

let f: Thunk = Box::new(|| println!("Hello from Thunk!"));
f();
```

- Reduces redundancy and improves readability.

## Conclusion

Advanced types in Rust provide powerful ways to handle complex data structures while improving code clarity and safety.
