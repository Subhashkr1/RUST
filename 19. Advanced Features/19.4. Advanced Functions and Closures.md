# Advanced Functions and Closures in Rust

## 1. Function Pointers

Rust allows functions to be used as values, enabling passing functions as parameters.

### Example:
```rust
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

fn do_twice(f: fn(i32) -> i32, arg: i32) -> i32 {
    f(arg) + f(arg)
}

let result = do_twice(add_one, 5);
println!("{}", result); // 12
```

- `fn(i32) -> i32` is a function pointer type.
- Unlike closures, function pointers are `Copy` and have a fixed size.

## 2. Returning Closures

Closures cannot be directly returned due to their unknown size. However, using trait objects (`Box<dyn Fn()>`) allows returning them dynamically.

### Example:
```rust
fn returns_closure() -> Box<dyn Fn(i32) -> i32> {
    Box::new(|x| x + 1)
}

let closure = returns_closure();
println!("{}", closure(10)); // 11
```

- `dyn Fn(i32) -> i32` represents any closure that takes an `i32` and returns an `i32`.
- `Box<dyn Fn()>` stores the closure on the heap to handle unknown size.

## 3. Function Traits: `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce`

Closures in Rust implement one of three traits based on how they capture variables:

- `Fn` → Immutable borrow (`&self`)
- `FnMut` → Mutable borrow (`&mut self`)
- `FnOnce` → Takes ownership (`self`)

### Example:
```rust
fn call<F: Fn()>(f: F) {
    f();
}

let hello = || println!("Hello, Rust!");
call(hello);
```

- The closure `hello` implements `Fn` because it does not modify any captured variables.

### `FnMut` Example:
```rust
fn call_mut<F: FnMut()>(mut f: F) {
    f();
}

let mut count = 0;
let mut increment = || count += 1;
call_mut(&mut increment);
println!("{}", count); // 1
```

- Since `increment` modifies `count`, it implements `FnMut`.

### `FnOnce` Example:
```rust
fn call_once<F: FnOnce()>(f: F) {
    f();
}

let greeting = String::from("Hello");
let consume = || println!("{}", greeting);
call_once(consume);
```

- `consume` takes ownership of `greeting`, making it an `FnOnce` closure.

## Conclusion

Rust’s advanced function features provide flexibility in designing functional programming paradigms while ensuring type safety and efficiency.
