# Trait Objects in Rust

Rust uses **trait objects** to enable dynamic dispatch and polymorphism. Unlike static dispatch, where function calls are determined at compile time, dynamic dispatch allows calling methods on different types at runtime through a common trait.

## 1. Defining Trait Objects

Trait objects are created using `&dyn Trait` or `Box<dyn Trait>`. They allow multiple concrete types to be used through a common interface.

### Example:
```rust
trait Draw {
    fn draw(&self);
}

struct Circle;

impl Draw for Circle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

struct Square;

impl Draw for Square {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a square");
    }
}

fn draw_object(object: &dyn Draw) {
    object.draw();
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Circle;
    let square = Square;
    draw_object(&circle);
    draw_object(&square);
}
```
- The `Draw` trait defines a common interface.
- `Circle` and `Square` implement `Draw`.
- `&dyn Draw` enables dynamic dispatch, meaning the actual method call is determined at runtime.

## 2. Using Trait Objects in Collections

Since Rust requires homogeneous types in collections, we use `Box<dyn Trait>` to store different trait implementations.

### Example:
```rust
let shapes: Vec<Box<dyn Draw>> = vec![Box::new(Circle), Box::new(Square)];
for shape in shapes.iter() {
    shape.draw();
}
```
- `Vec<Box<dyn Draw>>` allows storing different types implementing `Draw`.
- `Box<dyn Draw>` ensures heap allocation, maintaining ownership.

## 3. Trait Object Rules

1. **Only Object-Safe Traits Can Be Used as Trait Objects**
   - A trait is **object-safe** if:
     - It does not have generic methods (`fn method<T>(&self)`) except for those using `Self`.
     - It does not require `Self: Sized`.

2. **Trait Objects Use Dynamic Dispatch**
   - A vtable (virtual table) stores function pointers for runtime method resolution.

### Example of Non-Object-Safe Trait:
```rust
trait Invalid {
    fn do_something<T>(&self, item: T); // Not object-safe due to generics
}
```

## 4. Performance Considerations

- **Static dispatch** (default with traits) is faster since it resolves calls at compile time.
- **Dynamic dispatch** via trait objects has a slight performance cost due to vtable lookup.

## Conclusion

Trait objects provide **flexibility** by enabling polymorphism and dynamic dispatch. They allow for heterogeneous collections and decouple method calls from concrete types, making Rustâ€™s type system more adaptable.
