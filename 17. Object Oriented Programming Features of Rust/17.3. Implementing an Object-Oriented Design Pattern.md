# Object-Oriented Design Patterns in Rust

Rust supports object-oriented design patterns using traits, structs, and enums. Unlike traditional OOP languages, Rust emphasizes composition over inheritance, enforcing safety and performance.

## 1. Encapsulation with Structs and Methods

Encapsulation in Rust is achieved by using `structs` and `impl` blocks to define methods.

### Example:
```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}
```
- `Rectangle` encapsulates width and height.
- `impl` provides methods to interact with the struct.

## 2. Polymorphism with Traits and Trait Objects

Rust does not support inheritance but allows polymorphism through traits.

### Example:
```rust
trait Draw {
    fn draw(&self);
}

struct Circle;
impl Draw for Circle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

struct Square;
impl Draw for Square {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a square");
    }
}

fn draw_object(object: &dyn Draw) {
    object.draw();
}
```
- `Draw` trait enables polymorphism.
- `dyn Draw` allows dynamic dispatch.

## 3. State Pattern with Enums

The **State Pattern** can be implemented using Rust’s `enum` and `impl` blocks.

### Example:
```rust
struct Document {
    state: State,
}

enum State {
    Draft,
    Published,
}

impl Document {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Document { state: State::Draft }
    }
    fn publish(&mut self) {
        self.state = State::Published;
    }
}
```
- `enum` represents different states.
- Methods manipulate the state safely.

## 4. Strategy Pattern with Traits

Rust uses traits to implement the **Strategy Pattern**, allowing different behaviors at runtime.

### Example:
```rust
trait PaymentStrategy {
    fn pay(&self, amount: u32);
}

struct CreditCard;
impl PaymentStrategy for CreditCard {
    fn pay(&self, amount: u32) {
        println!("Paid {} with Credit Card", amount);
    }
}

struct PayPal;
impl PaymentStrategy for PayPal {
    fn pay(&self, amount: u32) {
        println!("Paid {} using PayPal", amount);
    }
}
```
- `PaymentStrategy` defines a common interface.
- Different implementations (`CreditCard`, `PayPal`) provide unique payment behaviors.

## Conclusion

Rust’s approach to object-oriented design relies on **composition, traits, and enums** instead of inheritance. These patterns ensure safety, flexibility, and efficient memory usage while following OOP principles in a Rust-friendly way.
