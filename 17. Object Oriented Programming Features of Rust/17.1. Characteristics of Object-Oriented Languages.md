# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Rust

Rust is not a traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) language, but it does support some OOP principles such as encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance-like behavior through traits.

## 1. Characteristics of OOP in Rust

### Encapsulation with Structs and `impl`
Rust allows defining structs with associated methods, encapsulating data and behavior together.

#### Example:
```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 20 };
    println!("Area: {}", rect.area());
}
```
- `Rectangle` encapsulates width and height.
- `impl Rectangle` provides methods to interact with the data.

### Inheritance via Traits
Rust doesnâ€™t have traditional class-based inheritance, but it supports polymorphism using **traits**.

#### Example:
```rust
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        3.14 * self.radius * self.radius
    }
}

fn print_area(shape: &impl Shape) {
    println!("Area: {}", shape.area());
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Circle { radius: 5.0 };
    print_area(&circle);
}
```
- `Shape` defines a trait (similar to an interface in other languages).
- `Circle` implements `Shape`, achieving polymorphism.

### Dynamic Dispatch with `dyn`
By default, Rust uses **static dispatch**, but we can use **dynamic dispatch** with `dyn` to achieve runtime polymorphism.

#### Example:
```rust
fn print_area(shape: &dyn Shape) {
    println!("Area: {}", shape.area());
}
```
- `&dyn Shape` allows different types implementing `Shape` to be used dynamically.

## 2. Differences from Traditional OOP

| Feature           | Rust Alternative |
|------------------|----------------|
| Classes          | Structs + `impl` |
| Inheritance      | Traits & Trait Objects |
| Methods         | Associated Functions |
| Polymorphism    | Traits & Dynamic Dispatch |

## Conclusion

Rust supports key OOP principles while enforcing ownership and borrowing rules to ensure safety. Instead of class-based inheritance, Rust encourages composition via traits, making it a unique and memory-safe alternative to traditional OOP languages.
