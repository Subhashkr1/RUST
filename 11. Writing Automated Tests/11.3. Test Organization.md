# Test Organization

Testing is a critical part of ensuring that code functions as expected. In Rust, testing is organized into two primary categories: **unit tests** and **integration tests**. 

## Unit Tests

### Purpose
Unit tests are small and focused on testing individual units of code in isolation. They typically test one module at a time and can also test private functions and interfaces. Unit tests are essential for identifying bugs in smaller portions of the code, ensuring that each unit functions correctly on its own.

### Structure
Unit tests are written within the same file as the code being tested. Rust encourages organizing unit tests within a module named `tests` inside the source file. You can enable the compilation of test code using the `#[cfg(test)]` annotation, ensuring tests are included only when running `cargo test`, not when building the project with `cargo build`.

### Example: Writing Unit Tests
Here's an example of how to organize unit tests in Rust:

```rust
// Filename: src/lib.rs

pub fn add(left: usize, right: usize) -> usize {
    left + right
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = add(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `#[cfg(test)]` annotation ensures that the tests are only compiled and run during testing.
- The `it_works` test checks whether the `add` function correctly sums two values.

### Testing Private Functions
Rust allows testing private functions, which may not be the case in some other languages. For instance, consider testing a private function that’s not marked with `pub`. You can still test it in the tests module using `use super::*`, which brings the parent module's items into scope.

```rust
// Filename: src/lib.rs

pub fn add_two(a: usize) -> usize {
    internal_adder(a, 2)
}

fn internal_adder(left: usize, right: usize) -> usize {
    left + right
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn internal() {
        let result = internal_adder(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}
```

Here, the `internal_adder` function is tested despite being private.

## Integration Tests

### Purpose
Integration tests focus on testing how different modules or components of a library work together. Unlike unit tests, which test isolated code, integration tests exercise your library's public API to ensure everything works as expected when combined.

### Structure
Integration tests are placed in a `tests` directory at the project’s root level, separate from the `src` directory. Each file in this directory is compiled as an independent crate. Integration tests can access only the public API of the library.

### Example: Writing Integration Tests
In an integration test, you don’t need the `#[cfg(test)]` annotation, as Cargo knows to look for tests in the `tests` directory when you run `cargo test`. Here's an example of an integration test:

```rust
// Filename: tests/integration_test.rs

use adder::add_two;

#[test]
fn it_adds_two() {
    let result = add_two(2);
    assert_eq!(result, 4);
}
```

Here, `add_two` is tested as part of the public API exposed by the `adder` crate.

### Running Integration Tests
You can run all tests, including both unit and integration tests, by simply using:

```bash
cargo test
```

To run a specific integration test file, use the `--test` flag followed by the file name:

```bash
cargo test --test integration_test
```

### Organizing Integration Tests
As your project grows, you may want to organize integration tests into multiple files within the `tests` directory. For example, you can create additional files for different sets of functionality.

### Example: Using Helper Functions
If you have helper functions that you want to use across multiple integration tests, you can place them in a `common.rs` file inside the `tests` directory. Rust treats files in subdirectories differently, so to avoid having the `common` file show up in the test results, use the `mod.rs` convention.

```rust
// Filename: tests/common/mod.rs

pub fn setup() {
    // setup code for tests
}
```

Then, in your integration test files, you can use:

```rust
// Filename: tests/integration_test.rs

use adder::add_two;
mod common;

#[test]
fn it_adds_two() {
    common::setup();

    let result = add_two(2);
    assert_eq!(result, 4);
}
```

### Integration Tests for Binary Crates
For projects that are binary crates (i.e., containing only a `main.rs` file and no `lib.rs`), integration tests can’t directly access functions in `main.rs`. To test functionality, it's best to separate your logic into a `lib.rs` file so that both unit and integration tests can access the public API.

## Summary

Rust provides two types of tests:
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and modules in isolation. They are written within the same file as the code and focus on correctness of smaller units.
- **Integration tests**: Test the library as a whole by interacting with the public API to ensure different components work together as expected.

By writing both types of tests, you can ensure that your Rust code is robust and free of logic bugs. While unit tests ensure individual correctness, integration tests help you confirm that everything functions as a cohesive whole.

Testing is an essential part of software development, and Rust’s test organization allows for clear separation of concerns and efficient testing strategies.
