# Writing Tests in Rust

## Introduction
Testing is an essential part of software development that ensures code behaves as expected. Rust provides a built-in test framework that enables writing and running tests efficiently.

## Creating and Running Tests
In Rust, tests are functions annotated with `#[test]`. To create and run tests:

1. Define test functions inside the `tests` module or alongside the implementation.
2. Run tests using `cargo test`.

Example of a simple test:

```rust
#[test]
fn it_works() {
    let result = 2 + 2;
    assert_eq!(result, 4);
}
```

Running `cargo test` will execute this test and verify that `2 + 2` equals `4`.

## Test Functions
A test function must follow these rules:
- It does not take parameters.
- It uses assertions to validate expected behavior.
- It is annotated with `#[test]`.

Rust provides different assertion macros:

- `assert!`: Ensures a condition is `true`.
- `assert_eq!`: Compares two values for equality.
- `assert_ne!`: Checks inequality of two values.

Example:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_assert_macros() {
    assert!(true);
    assert_eq!(5, 5);
    assert_ne!(5, 3);
}
```

## Checking for Expected Panics
Some functions should panic under certain conditions. Rust provides the `#[should_panic]` attribute to check for this behavior.

Example:

```rust
#[test]
#[should_panic]
fn test_panic() {
    panic!("This function should panic");
}
```

To make the test more precise, we can use the `expected` parameter:

```rust
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "division by zero")]
fn test_divide_by_zero() {
    let _ = 1 / 0;
}
```

## Using `Result<T, E>` in Tests
Instead of panicking, a test can return `Result<T, E>` to indicate success or failure.

Example:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_result() -> Result<(), String> {
    if 2 + 2 == 4 {
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err(String::from("Math error!"))
    }
}
```

A test fails if it returns `Err`.

## Running Tests
To execute all tests, use:

```sh
cargo test
```

For more output, run:

```sh
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

To run a specific test:

```sh
cargo test test_name
```

## Ignoring Tests
Some tests may take longer to run. Use `#[ignore]` to exclude them from default execution.

Example:

```rust
#[test]
#[ignore]
fn slow_test() {
    // Expensive computation
}
```

Run ignored tests using:

```sh
cargo test -- --ignored
```

## Organizing Tests
Tests can be structured using modules:

```rust
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_one() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_two() {
        assert_ne!(2 + 2, 5);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Rustâ€™s built-in testing framework provides powerful tools to ensure code correctness. With assertions, expected panics, result-based tests, and ignored tests, developers can write robust and efficient test suites.
