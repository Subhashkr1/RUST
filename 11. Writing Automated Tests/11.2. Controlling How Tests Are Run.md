# Controlling How Tests Are Run

`cargo test` is used to compile and run your tests in Rust. When you execute `cargo test`, it compiles the code in test mode and generates a test binary. By default, the binary runs all tests in parallel, captures the output, and displays the test results. However, you can control the behavior of `cargo test` with various command-line options.

### Running Tests in Parallel or Consecutively

By default, `cargo test` runs all tests in parallel, meaning that they are executed in separate threads, which speeds up test execution. However, this parallel execution can cause problems if your tests share resources or depend on each other.

For example, if two tests are writing to the same file at the same time, they may overwrite each other's data, causing tests to fail due to interference. To prevent this, you can control the number of threads used for parallel execution or even run tests one by one.

To run tests consecutively, without parallel execution, you can set the number of threads to 1 by passing the `--test-threads=1` flag to `cargo test`:

```bash
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

This option will cause all tests to run in a single thread, ensuring that they don't interfere with each other. While this may make test execution slower, it guarantees that tests don't depend on shared state or resources.

### Showing Function Output

By default, `cargo test` captures output from `println!` calls in tests. This helps reduce clutter in the test results. If a test passes, you won't see the output of `println!` calls, but if the test fails, the captured output will be shown along with the failure message.

For example, if you have a function that prints a value and returns a result, the printed output will be captured by default, as shown below:

```rust
fn prints_and_returns_10(a: i32) -> i32 {
    println!("I got the value {a}");
    10
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn this_test_will_pass() {
        let value = prints_and_returns_10(4);
        assert_eq!(value, 10);
    }

    #[test]
    fn this_test_will_fail() {
        let value = prints_and_returns_10(8);
        assert_eq!(value, 5);
    }
}
```

When you run the tests, the output will not show the `println!` messages unless the test fails. To also show output for passing tests, you can use the `--show-output` flag:

```bash
cargo test -- --show-output
```

With this flag, the printed values from both passing and failing tests will be displayed in the terminal.

### Running a Subset of Tests by Name

Sometimes, running the entire test suite can take a long time, especially in large projects. If you're working on specific code and want to test just a few functions, you can run only the relevant tests.

To run a specific test, provide the test's name as an argument:

```bash
cargo test one_hundred
```

This will only run the `one_hundred` test, while skipping the others. If you want to run multiple tests, you can filter tests by part of their names. For example, to run all tests containing `add` in their names, use:

```bash
cargo test add
```

This will run all tests with names such as `add_two_and_two`, `add_three_and_two`, etc., while skipping others.

### Ignoring Some Tests

Sometimes, certain tests are very time-consuming to run, such as tests that involve network calls or complex computations. If you want to exclude these tests from most test runs, you can use the `#[ignore]` attribute.

For example, to mark a test as ignored, you can add the `#[ignore]` attribute to the test:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = add(2, 2);
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }

    #[test]
    #[ignore]
    fn expensive_test() {
        // This test takes a long time to run
    }
}
```

Now, when you run `cargo test`, the `expensive_test` will be ignored:

```bash
cargo test
```

You will see an output indicating that the test was ignored:

```
test tests::expensive_test ... ignored
test tests::it_works ... ok
```

If you want to run only the ignored tests, you can use the `--ignored` flag:

```bash
cargo test -- --ignored
```

This will run only the tests marked with `#[ignore]`. To run all tests, including ignored ones, use the `--include-ignored` flag:

```bash
cargo test -- --include-ignored
```

### Summary of Commands:

- To run tests with no parallelism (one thread):
  ```bash
  cargo test -- --test-threads=1
  ```
  
- To show output from passing tests:
  ```bash
  cargo test -- --show-output
  ```
  
- To run a specific test:
  ```bash
  cargo test <test_name>
  ```
  
- To run multiple tests by matching part of the name:
  ```bash
  cargo test <partial_name>
  ```

- To ignore specific tests:
  ```bash
  #[test]
  #[ignore]
  ```

- To run ignored tests:
  ```bash
  cargo test -- --ignored
  ```

- To run all tests including ignored ones:
  ```bash
  cargo test -- --include-ignored
  ```

By using these command-line options, you can tailor the way tests are executed to make your testing process more efficient and relevant to your needs.
