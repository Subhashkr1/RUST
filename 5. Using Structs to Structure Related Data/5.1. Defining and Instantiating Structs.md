# Defining and Instantiating Structs in Rust

Structs in Rust allow for grouping related data together. Unlike tuples, structs provide named fields, making code more readable and maintainable.

## Defining a Struct
To define a struct, use the `struct` keyword:

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```

## Creating an Instance
To create an instance of a struct, specify values for all fields:

```rust
let user1 = User {
    active: true,
    username: String::from("someusername123"),
    email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
    sign_in_count: 1,
};
```

## Updating Struct Instances
Use the dot notation to modify a mutable struct:

```rust
let mut user1 = User {
    active: true,
    username: String::from("someusername123"),
    email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
    sign_in_count: 1,
};

user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
```

## Struct Update Syntax
To create a new struct instance with some values copied from another instance:

```rust
let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    ..user1
};
```

## Tuple Structs
Tuple structs are similar to tuples but with named struct types:

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
```

## Unit-Like Structs
Unit-like structs are useful for implementing traits without storing data:

```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

let subject = AlwaysEqual;
```

## Ownership in Structs
Struct fields should own their data (`String` instead of `&str`) unless using lifetimes. Borrowed references require explicit lifetimes, which are covered in more advanced Rust topics.
