# Method Syntax in Rust

## Overview
Methods in Rust are similar to functions but are defined within the context of a struct, enum, or trait object. Their first parameter is always `self`, representing the instance of the struct.

## Defining Methods

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };
    println!("The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.", rect1.area());
}
```

- The `impl` block defines methods associated with the `Rectangle` struct.
- The `self` parameter is used to reference the instance.

## Methods with More Parameters

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}
```

## Associated Functions
These are functions within `impl` blocks that do not take `self` as a parameter.

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
        Self { width: size, height: size }
    }
}
```

Usage:
```rust
let sq = Rectangle::square(3);
```

## Summary
- Methods are defined in `impl` blocks and take `self` as the first parameter.
- Associated functions do not take `self` and are called using `::`.
- Multiple `impl` blocks can be used for organizing methods efficiently.

Rustâ€™s method syntax provides a clear and structured way to define behaviors for custom types.
