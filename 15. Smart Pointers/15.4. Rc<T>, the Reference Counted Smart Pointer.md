# Rc<T>: The Reference Counted Smart Pointer

## Introduction
In Rust, when multiple parts of a program need to own data, the **Reference Counted Smart Pointer** (`Rc<T>`) is used. This type of pointer helps track the number of references to a value, ensuring that the data is dropped (cleaned up) only when no more references to it exist.

`Rc<T>` is useful when you need shared ownership of data, particularly in cases like tree structures or graphs, where multiple owners might need to access the same data.

## What is Rc<T>?
- `Rc<T>` stands for **Reference Counted**. It is a type that keeps track of the number of references to a value.
- It allows **multiple ownership** of data, meaning that more than one variable can "own" a piece of data, and the data will not be dropped until all owners are done with it.
- `Rc<T>` can only be used in single-threaded contexts. For multi-threaded cases, use `Arc<T>` (atomic reference counting).

## How Rc<T> Works
- `Rc<T>` keeps a reference count in the heap-allocated memory.
- When an `Rc<T>` instance is cloned, it doesn't clone the actual data; instead, it increases the reference count.
- When an `Rc<T>` is dropped (i.e., goes out of scope), the reference count is decreased. When the count reaches zero, the data is deallocated.
  
## Example of Rc<T> in Use

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(5);   // Creating an Rc<T> instance with value 5
    let b = Rc::clone(&a); // Cloning the Rc<T>, increasing the reference count
    let c = Rc::clone(&a); // Cloning the Rc<T> again
    
    println!("a = {}", a);
    println!("b = {}", b);
    println!("c = {}", c);
    
    // Rc<T> tracks the reference count and ensures that the data is cleaned up once all references are dropped.
}

Key Points
- Rc::new(value) creates a new Rc<T> with the provided value.
- Rc::clone(&a) increments the reference count for a without cloning the underlying data.
- The data is dropped once all Rc<T> references are out of scope.

### Rc<T> with Enums or Structs

Rc<T> is often used in combination with types like enum or struct to create recursive data structures like graphs or trees.

For example, you might use Rc<T> in a tree structure, where each node has a reference to a parent or children nodes.

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

struct Node {
    value: i32,
    children: Vec<Rc<Node>>,
}

fn main() {
    let child = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 5,
        children: Vec::new(),
    });

    let parent = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 10,
        children: vec![Rc::clone(&child)],
    });

    println!("Parent value: {}", parent.value);
    println!("Child value: {}", child.value);
}
```
