# Variables and Mutability

As mentioned in the “Storing Values with Variables” section, by default, variables are immutable. This is one of many nudges Rust gives you to write your code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers. However, you still have the option to make your variables mutable. Let’s explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor immutability and why sometimes you might want to opt out.

## Immutable Variables

When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can’t change that value. To illustrate this, generate a new project called `variables` in your projects directory by using:

```sh
cargo new variables
```

Then, in your new `variables` directory, open `src/main.rs` and replace its code with the following:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

This code does not compile! Running `cargo run` results in:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         - first assignment to `x`
3 |     println!("The value of x is: {x}");
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
  |
help: consider making this binding mutable
  |
2 |     let mut x = 5;
  |         +++
```

This error occurs because `x` is immutable. Rust enforces immutability to prevent unexpected changes, making programs safer and more predictable.

## Mutable Variables

To allow a variable to be changed, add `mut` before the variable name:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

Now, running the program outputs:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 5
The value of x is: 6
```

Using `mut` makes the code more flexible but should be used cautiously.

## Constants

Constants are always immutable and must have a type annotation:

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

### Differences Between Constants and Variables:
- Declared with `const`, not `let`.
- Always immutable; `mut` is not allowed.
- Can be defined in any scope, including global scope.
- Must be assigned a constant expression, not a runtime-computed value.

Constants improve code clarity and maintainability.

## Shadowing

Rust allows variable shadowing, where a new variable with the same name replaces the previous one:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

Output:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
```

### Shadowing vs. `mut`
- Shadowing creates a new variable; `mut` allows modification of the existing one.
- Shadowing allows changing variable types:

```rust
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```

- Using `mut` would cause a type mismatch error:

```rust
let mut spaces = "   ";
spaces = spaces.len(); // ERROR!
```

Shadowing provides flexibility while maintaining safety.
