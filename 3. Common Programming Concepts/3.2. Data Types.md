# Rust Data Types

Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. Weâ€™ll look at two data type subsets: scalar and compound.

Rust is a statically typed language, which means it must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually infer the type based on the value and how it is used. However, in cases where multiple types are possible, we must add a type annotation. For example:

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

If the type annotation `: u32` is omitted, Rust will display an error:

```
error[E0284]: type annotations needed
```

## Scalar Types

A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

### Integer Types

An integer is a number without a fractional component. Rust provides several integer types. For example, `u32` is an unsigned integer type that takes up 32 bits. Below is a table showing the built-in integer types:

| Length | Signed | Unsigned |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 8-bit  | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit| i128   | u128     |
| arch   | isize  | usize    |

Each variant can be either signed (i.e., can be negative) or unsigned (i.e., always positive). The `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on.

### Integer Literals

Rust supports different forms for integer literals. You can represent numbers as decimal, hexadecimal, octal, or binary:

| Number Literals  | Example  |
|------------------|----------|
| Decimal          | 98_222   |
| Hexadecimal      | 0xff     |
| Octal            | 0o77     |
| Binary           | 0b1111_0000 |
| Byte (u8 only)   | b'A'     |

### Integer Overflow

If you try to assign a value to a variable that exceeds its range, integer overflow will occur. In **debug mode**, Rust will panic. In **release mode**, Rust will wrap the value around using twoâ€™s complement.

To explicitly handle overflow, Rust provides methods like `wrapping_add`, `checked_*`, `overflowing_*`, and `saturating_*`.

### Floating-Point Types

Rust supports two floating-point types: `f32` and `f64` (32 and 64 bits, respectively). The default type is `f64`.

```rust
let x = 2.0; // f64
let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
```

Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard.

### Numeric Operations

Rust supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.

```rust
fn main() {
    let sum = 5 + 10;
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;
    let product = 4 * 30;
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

### The Boolean Type

Booleans in Rust can be `true` or `false`, and are of type `bool`. They are commonly used in conditionals.

```rust
let t = true;
let f: bool = false;
```

### The Character Type

The `char` type in Rust represents a Unicode scalar value, which can be much more than just ASCII. Itâ€™s always 4 bytes in size.

```rust
let c = 'z';
let z: char = 'â„¤';
let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
```

## Compound Types

Compound types group multiple values into one type. Rust provides two compound types: tuples and arrays.

### The Tuple Type

A tuple allows grouping multiple values with different types. Tuples have a fixed length.

```rust
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
```

To access values in a tuple, you can use pattern matching:

```rust
let (x, y, z) = tup;
println!("The value of y is: {y}");
```

Or use direct indexing:

```rust
let five_hundred = x.0;
let six_point_four = x.1;
let one = x.2;
```

### The Array Type

Arrays hold multiple values of the same type and have a fixed length. They are stored on the stack, unlike vectors, which are heap-allocated.

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

To specify the type and length:

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

You can also initialize an array with the same value for all elements:

```rust
let a = [3; 5]; // [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```

### Accessing Array Elements

You can access array elements using indexing:

```rust
let first = a[0];
let second = a[1];
```

### Invalid Array Element Access

If you try to access an index that is out of bounds, the program will panic:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let mut index = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut index).expect("Failed to read line");

    let index: usize = index.trim().parse().expect("Not a number");
    let element = a[index];
    println!("Element at index {index} is {element}");
}
```

Running this code with an invalid index (e.g., 10) will cause a panic:

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10'
```
