# Unrecoverable Errors with `panic!`

## Introduction
Sometimes, errors occur in your Rust program that cannot be handled. In such cases, Rust provides the `panic!` macro. A panic can occur due to:
1. Actions that cause a panic (e.g., accessing an array out of bounds).
2. Explicitly calling `panic!`.

By default, panics print an error message, unwind the stack, and terminate the program. You can enable backtrace using `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for debugging.

## Unwinding vs. Aborting
By default, Rust unwinds the stack during a panic, cleaning up resources. Alternatively, you can configure your program to abort immediately without cleanup, which reduces binary size:

```toml
[profile.release]
panic = 'abort'
```

## Example: Triggering a Panic
```rust
fn main() {
    panic!("crash and burn");
}
```
Running this will produce:
```sh
$ cargo run
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:2:5:
crash and burn
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` to display a backtrace
```

## Example: Out-of-Bounds Access
```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    v[99];
}
```
This results in:
```sh
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:6:
index out of bounds: the len is 3 but the index is 99
```

## Using Backtraces
To get a backtrace, run:
```sh
$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run
```
This displays a list of function calls leading to the panic, helping identify the source of the error.
