# To Panic! or Not to Panic!

## When to Use `panic!` vs. `Result`
- Use `panic!` when failure is **unrecoverable**.
- Use `Result` when failure is **expected** and the calling code should handle it.
- Returning `Result` provides flexibility for recovery.

## Cases Where `panic!` is Appropriate
### 1. **Examples, Prototypes, and Tests**
- `unwrap` and `expect` make prototype code cleaner.
- In tests, failures should panic.

### 2. **When You Have More Information Than the Compiler**
- Use `unwrap` when logic guarantees a `Result` will be `Ok`.
- Example:
  ```rust
  let home: IpAddr = "127.0.0.1"
      .parse()
      .expect("Hardcoded IP should be valid");
  ```

## Guidelines for Error Handling
- Panic if your code enters a **bad state** where assumptions are broken.
- Return `Result` when failure is **expected** and recoverable.
- Validate inputs before proceeding to prevent vulnerabilities.

## Using Rust's Type System for Safety
- Use Rust’s **type system** to enforce valid states at compile time.
- Example: `Guess` struct ensures values are between 1 and 100.
  ```rust
  pub struct Guess {
      value: i32,
  }

  impl Guess {
      pub fn new(value: i32) -> Guess {
          if value < 1 || value > 100 {
              panic!("Guess must be between 1 and 100.");
          }
          Guess { value }
      }
  }
  ```

## Summary
- `panic!` is for **critical failures**.
- `Result` is for **recoverable errors**.
- Leverage Rust’s **type system** to prevent invalid states.
- Thoughtful error handling makes your code **more robust** and **secure**.
