# Publishing a Crate to Crates.io

Weâ€™ve used packages from crates.io as dependencies in our project, but you can also share your code with others by publishing your own packages. The crate registry at crates.io distributes the source code of your packages, so it primarily hosts open-source code.

Rust and Cargo have features that make your published package easier for people to find and use. This guide covers the steps to publish a package.

## Making Useful Documentation Comments

Accurately documenting your packages will help other users understand how and when to use them. Rust has a special kind of comment for documentation, which generates HTML documentation. The HTML displays the contents of documentation comments for public API items intended for programmers interested in how to use your crate.

### Documentation Comments Syntax
Use `///` to write documentation comments and support Markdown formatting. Documentation comments should be placed just before the item they are documenting.

### Example:

```rust
/// Adds one to the number given.
/// 
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let arg = 5;
/// let answer = my_crate::add_one(arg);
///
/// assert_eq!(6, answer);
/// ```
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

### Commonly Used Sections
Here are some common sections that crate authors use in documentation:

- **Panics**: Describes scenarios where the function might panic.
- **Errors**: Describes possible errors for functions that return `Result`.
- **Safety**: Explains why the function is unsafe (if applicable).

### Documentation Comments as Tests
Example code in documentation comments can also act as tests. Running `cargo test` will execute these examples and ensure they work as expected.

### Commenting Contained Items
Use `//!` for documenting the item that contains the comment, like the crate or module itself.

Example:

```rust
//! # My Crate
//!
//! `my_crate` is a collection of utilities to make performing certain
//! calculations more convenient.

/// Adds one to the number given.
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

## Exporting a Convenient Public API with `pub use`

When designing the public API of your crate, use `pub use` to re-export items for a more user-friendly API. This allows users to access functions or structs without needing to dive into nested modules.

### Example:

```rust
// Before: Items are nested inside modules
pub mod kinds {
    pub enum PrimaryColor { Red, Yellow, Blue }
}

pub mod utils {
    use crate::kinds::*;
    pub fn mix(c1: PrimaryColor, c2: PrimaryColor) -> String { "mixed".to_string() }
}

// After: Re-export for a simpler public API
pub use self::kinds::PrimaryColor;
pub use self::utils::mix;
```

Now users can use the crate like this:

```rust
use art::PrimaryColor;
use art::mix;
```

## Setting Up a Crates.io Account

Before publishing a crate, you need to create an account on crates.io and obtain an API token.

### Steps:
1. Visit [crates.io](https://crates.io) and log in via GitHub.
2. Go to your account settings [here](https://crates.io/me/) and retrieve your API key.
3. Run the following command to log in:

```bash
$ cargo login
```

Paste your API key when prompted.

## Adding Metadata to a New Crate

Before publishing, add metadata to the `Cargo.toml` file, including a unique name, description, and license.

### Example `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "guessing_game"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
description = "A fun game where you guess what number the computer has chosen."
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"
```

### Publishing the Crate

After setting up the `Cargo.toml`, you can now publish your crate.

### Command to Publish:

```bash
$ cargo publish
```

Cargo will update the index, package your crate, and upload it to crates.io.

### Important Note:
- Once a crate version is published, it cannot be overwritten or deleted, making it a permanent part of the crates.io archive.
- You can publish multiple versions, but once a version is published, it stays archived forever.

## Publishing a New Version of an Existing Crate

If you make changes and want to release a new version, update the version number in `Cargo.toml` and re-publish.

### Example:

```toml
[package]
name = "guessing_game"
version = "0.2.0"
```

Then run:

```bash
$ cargo publish
```

## Deprecating Versions with `cargo yank`

You cannot delete previous versions, but you can prevent new projects from depending on broken versions using `cargo yank`.

### Yank Command:

```bash
$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1
```

This will mark the version as yanked, preventing new projects from using it, while existing projects will continue to work.

To undo the yank:

```bash
$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1 --undo
```

### Conclusion
Publishing crates on crates.io helps the Rust community by sharing reusable code. Follow the steps above to ensure your crate is well-documented, structured, and easy to use by others.
