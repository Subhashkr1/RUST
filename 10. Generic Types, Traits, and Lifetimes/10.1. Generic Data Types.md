# Generic Data Types in Rust

## Overview
Generics allow us to write flexible, reusable code by enabling type parameterization in functions, structs, enums, and methods. This helps in reducing code duplication while maintaining type safety.

## Function Definitions
By using generics in function signatures, we create flexible functions that work with multiple types. Example:

```rust
fn largest<T: std::cmp::PartialOrd>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];
    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    largest
}
```

## Struct Definitions
Generics can be used in structs to define flexible data structures.

```rust
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
```

## Enum Definitions
Rust standard enums like `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` leverage generics for flexibility.

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

## Method Definitions
We can implement methods for generic structs:

```rust
impl<T> Point<T, T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}
```

Methods can also use different generic parameters:

```rust
impl<X1, Y1> Point<X1, Y1> {
    fn mixup<X2, Y2>(self, other: Point<X2, Y2>) -> Point<X1, Y2> {
        Point { x: self.x, y: other.y }
    }
}
```

## Performance
Rust optimizes generic code via *monomorphization*, where it generates specific implementations for used types at compile time, ensuring no runtime overhead.

```rust
enum Option_i32 { Some(i32), None }
enum Option_f64 { Some(f64), None }
```

This results in highly efficient code execution similar to manually defined types.

Generics enhance Rustâ€™s flexibility while maintaining performance and type safety, making them a powerful feature for writing reusable and optimized code.
