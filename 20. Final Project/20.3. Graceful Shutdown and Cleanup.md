# Graceful Shutdown and Cleanup

The code in Listing 20-20 allows requests to be handled asynchronously using a thread pool. However, when using `Ctrl+C` to stop the server, all threads are terminated abruptly, even if they are processing a request.

## Implementing the Drop Trait on ThreadPool

To ensure graceful shutdown, we implement the `Drop` trait to join each thread before closing.

```rust
impl Drop for ThreadPool {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        for worker in &mut self.workers {
            println!("Shutting down worker {}", worker.id);
            worker.thread.join().unwrap();
        }
    }
}
```

This approach does not compile due to ownership issues with `worker.thread`. To resolve this, we modify `Worker` to store the thread inside an `Option`:

```rust
struct Worker {
    id: usize,
    thread: Option<thread::JoinHandle<()>>,
}
```

Now, we update `Worker::new` to wrap the thread inside `Some()`:

```rust
impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize, receiver: Arc<Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<Job>>>) -> Worker {
        let thread = thread::spawn(move || {
            loop {
                let message = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv();
                match message {
                    Ok(job) => {
                        println!("Worker {id} got a job; executing.");
                        job();
                    }
                    Err(_) => {
                        println!("Worker {id} disconnected; shutting down.");
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        });
        
        Worker {
            id,
            thread: Some(thread),
        }
    }
}
```

## Signaling Threads to Stop

To shut down the server properly, we modify `ThreadPool` to drop the `sender` before waiting for worker threads to finish:

```rust
pub struct ThreadPool {
    workers: Vec<Worker>,
    sender: Option<mpsc::Sender<Job>>,
}

impl Drop for ThreadPool {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        drop(self.sender.take());
        
        for worker in &mut self.workers {
            println!("Shutting down worker {}", worker.id);
            if let Some(thread) = worker.thread.take() {
                thread.join().unwrap();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Dropping `sender` signals workers that no more jobs will arrive, allowing them to terminate gracefully.

## Modifying `main.rs`

We update `main.rs` to accept only two requests before shutting down:

```rust
fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7878").unwrap();
    let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);

    for stream in listener.incoming().take(2) {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();
        pool.execute(|| {
            handle_connection(stream);
        });
    }

    println!("Shutting down.");
}
```

This implementation ensures all worker threads terminate cleanly after serving two requests. The graceful shutdown guarantees proper cleanup of resources before exiting.
