## Final Project: Building a Multithreaded Web Server

It’s been a long journey, but we’ve reached the end of the book. In this chapter, we’ll build one more project together to demonstrate some of the concepts we covered in the final chapters, as well as recap some earlier lessons.

For our final project, we’ll make a web server that says “hello” and looks like Figure 20-1 in a web browser.

   hello from rust


Here is our plan for building the web server:

Learn a bit about TCP and HTTP.
Listen for TCP connections on a socket.
Parse a small number of HTTP requests.
Create a proper HTTP response.
Improve the throughput of our server with a thread pool.
Before we get started, we should mention one detail: the method we’ll use won’t be the best way to build a web server with Rust. Community members have published a number of production-ready crates available on crates.io that provide more complete web server and thread pool implementations than we’ll build. However, our intention in this chapter is to help you learn, not to take the easy route. Because Rust is a systems programming language, we can choose the level of abstraction we want to work with and can go to a lower level than is possible or practical in other languages. We’ll therefore write the basic HTTP server and thread pool manually so you can learn the general ideas and techniques behind the crates you might use in the future.

# Building a Single-Threaded Web Server in Rust

## Overview
This section of *The Rust Programming Language* book (Chapter 20.1) guides us through creating a basic single-threaded web server using Rust. The primary goal is to understand low-level networking concepts, handle HTTP requests, and structure a simple server.

## Steps to Build the Web Server

### 1. Setting Up the Project
Create a new Rust project:
```sh
cargo new simple-web-server
cd simple-web-server
```

Edit `Cargo.toml` to ensure dependencies are properly configured (though we don't need external crates for this simple server).

### 2. Binding to a TCP Listener
To accept connections, we use Rust’s `std::net::TcpListener`:

```rust
use std::net::TcpListener;
use std::net::TcpStream;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7878").unwrap();
    println!("Listening on port 7878...");

    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();
        handle_connection(stream);
    }
}
```

- `TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7878")` creates a server listening on `localhost:7878`.
- The loop iterates over incoming connections, handling each one individually.

### 3. Handling a Connection
We define a function to handle the TCP stream:

```rust
fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let mut buffer = [0; 1024];
    stream.read(&mut buffer).unwrap();
    
    let response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\nHello, World!";
    stream.write(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
    stream.flush().unwrap();
}
```

- The request data is read into a buffer.
- A simple HTTP response (`200 OK`) is sent back to the client.

### 4. Serving HTML Files
To serve an actual HTML file instead of a plain text response:

```rust
fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let mut buffer = [0; 1024];
    stream.read(&mut buffer).unwrap();

    let contents = fs::read_to_string("index.html").unwrap();
    let response = format!("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n{}", contents);

    stream.write(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
    stream.flush().unwrap();
}
```

- The `index.html` file is read from disk and sent in the response.
- This allows serving basic web pages via Rust.

### 5. Handling Requests & 404 Errors
We enhance our server to recognize different routes and return a `404 Not Found` response for invalid URLs.

```rust
fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let mut buffer = [0; 1024];
    stream.read(&mut buffer).unwrap();

    let get = b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n";
    
    let (status_line, filename) = if buffer.starts_with(get) {
        ("HTTP/1.1 200 OK", "index.html")
    } else {
        ("HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND", "404.html")
    };

    let contents = fs::read_to_string(filename).unwrap();
    let response = format!("{}\r\n\r\n{}", status_line, contents);

    stream.write(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
    stream.flush().unwrap();
}
```

- Requests are checked to see if they match `GET /`.
- If not, a `404.html` file is served.

## Conclusion
This implementation provides a foundational web server using Rust’s standard library. While it is single-threaded and basic, it demonstrates key concepts like:

- Handling TCP connections
- Reading HTTP requests
- Sending HTTP responses
- Serving static files
- Basic error handling

### Next Steps
For improvements, consider:
- Adding multithreading for handling multiple connections
- Using Rust’s `tokio` for async handling
- Supporting more HTTP methods
- Serving dynamic content using templates

This simple project is a great way to explore Rust’s networking capabilities and HTTP handling!
