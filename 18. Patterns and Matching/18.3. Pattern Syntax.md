# Pattern Syntax in Rust

Pattern matching in Rust is a powerful and expressive feature that allows you to compare values against patterns and execute corresponding code. It is widely used with `match` expressions and `if let` statements. This section will cover various aspects of pattern syntax in Rust.

## 1. What is Pattern Matching?

Pattern matching allows you to match values against patterns, enabling code execution based on the matched pattern. It's a key feature in Rust, especially in control flow structures.

Example:

```rust
let x = 5;
match x {
    1 => println!("one"),
    2 => println!("two"),
    3 => println!("three"),
    _ => println!("something else"),
}
```
- The value `5` matches the wildcard `_` pattern, printing "something else".

## 2. Literals

You can match exact values like numbers or strings.

Example:

```rust
let x = 42;
match x {
    42 => println!("The Answer!"),
    _ => println!("Not the Answer"),
}
```
Here, the pattern `42` matches the value `42`, so "The Answer!" is printed.

## 3. Named Variables

You can bind a value to a variable using a pattern. This allows you to use the matched value later in the match arm.

Example:

```rust
let x = 5;
match x {
    x => println!("Matched, and x is {}", x),
}
```
In this example, the value `5` is bound to the variable `x` in the match arm.

## 4. Multiple Patterns

You can match multiple patterns in one arm by separating them with the pipe `|`.

Example:

```rust
let x = 1;
match x {
    1 | 2 => println!("One or two!"),
    _ => println!("Something else"),
}
```
This will print "One or two!" if `x` is either `1` or `2`.

## 5. Range Patterns

Rust supports matching ranges of values. This is done using the `..` syntax.

Example:

```rust
let x = 5;
match x {
    1..=5 => println!("Between 1 and 5"),
    _ => println!("Greater than 5"),
}
```
Here, `1..=5` will match any value from 1 to 5 (inclusive).

## 6. Destructuring Patterns

Patterns can destructure data types such as structs, enums, tuples, or arrays.

### Tuple Destructuring:

```rust
let point = (0, 7);
match point {
    (0, y) => println!("On the y-axis at {}", y),
    (x, 0) => println!("On the x-axis at {}", x),
    _ => println!("Somewhere else"),
}
```
In this example, the first pattern `(0, y)` destructures the tuple into `0` for `x` and binds the second element to `y`.

### Struct Destructuring:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let point = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };
match point {
    Point { x, y: 0 } => println!("On the x-axis at {}", x),
    Point { x: 0, y } => println!("On the y-axis at {}", y),
    _ => println!("Somewhere else"),
}
```
Here, `Point { x, y: 0 }` destructures a `Point` struct and matches when the `y` value is `0`.

## 7. Enums and Option Types

Pattern matching is often used with enums like `Option<T>`, which can either be `Some(T)` or `None`.

Example:

```rust
let value = Some(5);
match value {
    Some(x) => println!("Got a value: {}", x),
    None => println!("No value"),
}
```
This will print "Got a value: 5" if `value` is `Some(5)`.

## 8. Refutable vs. Irrefutable Patterns

- **Refutable patterns**: Can fail to match a value, like `Some(x)` or `1..=5`.
- **Irrefutable patterns**: Always match a value, such as when binding variables (e.g., `x =>`).

## 9. Advanced Matching Features

- **@ Bindings**: You can bind a value and match at the same time using `@`:
  ```rust
  let x = 5;
  match x {
      1..=10 @ 5 => println!("Matched, and x is {}", 10),
      _ => println!("No match"),
  }
  ```

- **Refinement Patterns**: Combine patterns for more complex matches.

## Conclusion

Pattern matching in Rust is a powerful and essential feature for handling various types of data. It enables concise and expressive code when working with simple types, enums, structs, and more. By mastering pattern syntax, you can write more readable and efficient Rust code.
