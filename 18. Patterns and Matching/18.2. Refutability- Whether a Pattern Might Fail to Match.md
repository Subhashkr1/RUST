# All the Places Patterns Can Be Used in Rust

Rust provides a powerful pattern matching feature that can be used in multiple places throughout the language. This document covers all such places where patterns are applicable.

## 1. `match` Expressions

`match` is one of the most common places where patterns are used.

### Example:
```rust
let number = 5;
match number {
    1 => println!("One"),
    2 | 3 | 5 | 7 => println!("Prime number"),
    _ => println!("Something else"),
}
```

- Patterns can include literal values, multiple patterns (`|`), and catch-all cases (`_`).

## 2. `if let` Expressions

`if let` allows concise pattern matching when only one case is relevant.

### Example:
```rust
let some_value = Some(42);
if let Some(x) = some_value {
    println!("Matched: {}", x);
}
```

- This is an alternative to `match` when handling specific cases.

## 3. `while let` Loops

`while let` runs a loop as long as the pattern matches.

### Example:
```rust
let mut numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
while let Some(x) = numbers.pop() {
    println!("Popped: {}", x);
}
```

- This is useful when working with iterators or stack-like structures.

## 4. `for` Loops

Patterns can be used to destructure elements in `for` loops.

### Example:
```rust
let points = vec![(0, 0), (1, 2), (3, 4)];
for (x, y) in points {
    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);
}
```

- Here, `(x, y)` pattern extracts values from each tuple in the vector.

## 5. `let` Statements

Patterns can destructure values in `let` bindings.

### Example:
```rust
let (a, b, c) = (1, 2, 3);
println!("a: {}, b: {}, c: {}", a, b, c);
```

- Multiple values can be assigned at once using patterns.

## 6. Function Parameters

Patterns can be used in function signatures to destructure arguments.

### Example:
```rust
fn print_coordinates((x, y): (i32, i32)) {
    println!("Coordinates: ({}, {})", x, y);
}

print_coordinates((10, 20));
```

- Function arguments can be directly unpacked into variables.

## 7. Refutability in Patterns

Patterns in Rust can be **refutable** or **irrefutable**:

- **Irrefutable patterns** always match (e.g., `let (x, y) = (1, 2);`).
- **Refutable patterns** may fail to match (e.g., `if let Some(x) = value`).

### Example of Irrefutable Pattern:
```rust
let (a, b) = (10, 20); // Always succeeds
```

### Example of Refutable Pattern:
```rust
if let Some(x) = None {
    println!("Matched: {}", x);
} else {
    println!("Pattern did not match");
}
```

- `if let Some(x) = None` is refutable because `None` does not match `Some(x)`.

## Conclusion

Rust's pattern matching system allows for expressive and flexible code. Understanding all the places where patterns can be used and their refutability improves readability and conciseness in Rust programs.
