# Shared State in Rust

In addition to message passing, Rust provides shared state concurrency using mutexes and atomic reference counting. This approach enables multiple threads to safely access and modify shared data.

## 1. Using `Mutex<T>` for Safe Mutability

Rust’s `std::sync::Mutex<T>` allows multiple threads to safely access shared data by ensuring only one thread can access the data at a time.

### Example:
```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let m = Mutex::new(5);
    {
        let mut num = m.lock().unwrap();
        *num = 6;
    }
    println!("m = {:?}", m);
}
```

- `Mutex::new(5)` creates a mutex-protected value.
- `.lock().unwrap()` acquires the lock to access the value.
- The lock is automatically released when `num` goes out of scope.

## 2. Sharing a `Mutex<T>` Across Threads with `Arc<T>`

Since `Mutex<T>` is not thread-safe by itself, we use `Arc<T>` (Atomic Reference Counting) to share ownership among multiple threads.

### Example:
```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Counter: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```

- `Arc::new(Mutex::new(0))` wraps the mutex in an atomic reference counter.
- `Arc::clone(&counter)` ensures multiple threads can access the same mutex safely.
- `lock().unwrap()` grants exclusive access to modify the counter.

## 3. `RwLock<T>` for Read-Write Access

`std::sync::RwLock<T>` allows multiple readers or a single writer at a time, improving efficiency in read-heavy workloads.

### Example:
```rust
use std::sync::RwLock;

fn main() {
    let lock = RwLock::new(5);
    {
        let r1 = lock.read().unwrap();
        let r2 = lock.read().unwrap();
        println!("Read values: {} and {}", *r1, *r2);
    }
    {
        let mut w = lock.write().unwrap();
        *w = 10;
    }
    println!("Updated value: {}", *lock.read().unwrap());
}
```

- `.read()` allows multiple readers simultaneously.
- `.write()` ensures exclusive access for writing.

## Conclusion

Rust’s shared state concurrency model, using `Mutex<T>`, `Arc<T>`, and `RwLock<T>`, ensures safety and efficiency while working with multiple threads. Proper locking mechanisms prevent data races while allowing efficient parallelism.
