# Message Passing in Rust

Rust encourages message passing as a safe way to communicate between threads. The standard library provides channels for transferring data between threads safely.

## 1. Creating a Channel

Rust's `std::sync::mpsc` (multiple producer, single consumer) module provides channels for communication.

### Example:
```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel(); // Create a channel

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let message = String::from("Hello from thread");
        tx.send(message).unwrap(); // Send message
    });

    let received = rx.recv().unwrap(); // Receive message
    println!("Received: {}", received);
}
```

- `mpsc::channel()` creates a transmitter (`tx`) and receiver (`rx`).
- `tx.send()` sends data to the channel.
- `rx.recv()` waits for and retrieves the message.

## 2. Sending Multiple Messages

The receiver can process multiple messages in a loop.

### Example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let messages = vec!["Hello", "from", "Rust"];
        for msg in messages {
            tx.send(msg.to_string()).unwrap();
        }
    });

    for received in rx {
        println!("Received: {}", received);
    }
}
```

- `for received in rx` continuously receives messages until the sender closes.

## 3. Using Multiple Producers

Multiple threads can send messages using cloned transmitters.

### Example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let tx1 = tx.clone();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        tx.send(String::from("Message from tx")).unwrap();
    });

    thread::spawn(move || {
        tx1.send(String::from("Message from tx1")).unwrap();
    });

    for received in rx {
        println!("Received: {}", received);
    }
}
```

- `tx.clone()` allows multiple threads to send messages to a single receiver.
- The receiver processes messages as they arrive.

## Conclusion

Message passing via channels ensures safe and structured communication between threads. Rustâ€™s ownership and type system make it easier to write concurrent code without data races.
