## Fearless Concurrency

Handling concurrent programming safely and efficiently is another of Rustâ€™s major goals. Concurrent programming, where different parts of a program execute independently, and parallel programming, where different parts of a program execute at the same time, are becoming increasingly important as more computers take advantage of their multiple processors. Historically, programming in these contexts has been difficult and error prone: Rust hopes to change that.

# Threads in Rust

Rust provides support for concurrent programming using threads, enabling parallel execution of tasks. Rust's threading model ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector.

## 1. Creating Threads with `spawn`

The `std::thread::spawn` function allows spawning new threads.

### Example:
```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..5 {
            println!("Spawned thread: {}", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("Main thread: {}", i);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
    }
}
```

- The spawned thread runs independently from the main thread.
- The `thread::sleep` function simulates work being done.

## 2. Waiting for Threads to Finish (`join`)

To ensure that a spawned thread completes before exiting the main thread, we use `join`.

### Example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..5 {
            println!("Spawned thread: {}", i);
        }
    });

    handle.join().unwrap(); // Wait for the spawned thread to finish
    println!("Main thread finished");
}
```

- Calling `join` on the handle ensures the thread completes before proceeding.

## 3. Moving Data into Threads

Threads run in separate memory spaces, so they require the `move` keyword to take ownership of values from the main thread.

### Example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let message = String::from("Hello from thread");
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("{}", message);
    });

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

- The `move` keyword ensures `message` is moved into the thread, preventing borrowing issues.

## 4. Using Threads Safely

Rust prevents data races through ownership and borrowing rules. Using shared state across threads requires synchronization techniques like mutexes and channels.

## Conclusion

Rust provides powerful yet safe threading mechanisms. Using `spawn`, `join`, and `move`, we can efficiently create and manage concurrent tasks while ensuring memory safety.
