# Comparing Performance: Loops vs. Iterators

To determine whether loops or iterators are faster, we benchmarked the search function using both approaches. The test involved searching for the word "the" in *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes* by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

### Benchmark Results
```
test bench_search_for  ... bench:  19,620,300 ns/iter (+/- 915,700)
test bench_search_iter ... bench:  19,234,900 ns/iter (+/- 657,200)
```
The iterator version was slightly faster, demonstrating that Rust’s iterators are optimized to perform as efficiently as manual loops.

### Iterators as Zero-Cost Abstractions
Rust compiles iterators down to low-level code, eliminating runtime overhead. This follows the *zero-overhead principle* in C++:
> "What you don’t use, you don’t pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better."

### Real-World Example: Audio Decoder
Consider the following Rust code used in an audio decoding algorithm:
```rust
let buffer: &mut [i32];
let coefficients: [i64; 12];
let qlp_shift: i16;

for i in 12..buffer.len() {
    let prediction = coefficients.iter()
                                 .zip(&buffer[i - 12..i])
                                 .map(|(&c, &s)| c * s as i64)
                                 .sum::<i64>() >> qlp_shift;
    let delta = buffer[i];
    buffer[i] = prediction as i32 + delta;
}
```
Rust optimizes this by *loop unrolling*, eliminating overhead and improving performance. Coefficients are stored in registers, and bounds checks are avoided.

### Summary
Closures and iterators in Rust enable high-level abstraction with low-level performance. They provide expressiveness without runtime penalties, aligning with Rust’s zero-cost abstraction philosophy.
