# Closures: Anonymous Functions that Capture Their Environment

Rust's closures are anonymous functions that can be saved in variables or passed as arguments to other functions. Unlike regular functions, closures can capture values from the environment in which they're defined, allowing for enhanced code reuse and behavior customization.

## Capturing the Environment with Closures

Consider a scenario where a t-shirt company offers a limited-edition shirt to someone on their mailing list. If the selected individual has specified a favorite color, they receive a shirt in that color; otherwise, they get the color that the company has the most in stock.

Here's an example implementation:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Copy, Clone)]
enum ShirtColor {
    Red,
    Blue,
}

struct Inventory {
    shirts: Vec<ShirtColor>,
}

impl Inventory {
    fn giveaway(&self, user_preference: Option<ShirtColor>) -> ShirtColor {
        user_preference.unwrap_or_else(|| self.most_stocked())
    }

    fn most_stocked(&self) -> ShirtColor {
        let mut num_red = 0;
        let mut num_blue = 0;

        for color in &self.shirts {
            match color {
                ShirtColor::Red => num_red += 1,
                ShirtColor::Blue => num_blue += 1,
            }
        }
        if num_red > num_blue {
            ShirtColor::Red
        } else {
            ShirtColor::Blue
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let store = Inventory {
        shirts: vec![ShirtColor::Blue, ShirtColor::Red, ShirtColor::Blue],
    };

    let user_pref1 = Some(ShirtColor::Red);
    let giveaway1 = store.giveaway(user_pref1);
    println!(
        "The user with preference {:?} gets {:?}",
        user_pref1, giveaway1
    );

    let user_pref2 = None;
    let giveaway2 = store.giveaway(user_pref2);
    println!(
        "The user with preference {:?} gets {:?}",
        user_pref2, giveaway2
    );
}
```

In this code:

- The `Inventory` struct contains a list of available shirt colors.
- The `giveaway` method determines which shirt color to give away based on the user's preference. It uses the `unwrap_or_else` method, which takes a closure as an argument. If `user_preference` is `Some`, it returns the contained value; if it's `None`, it calls the provided closure to determine the shirt color.
- The closure `|| self.most_stocked()` captures the `self` reference from its environment to call the `most_stocked` method.

When run, this program outputs:

```
The user with preference Some(Red) gets Red
The user with preference None gets Blue
```

This demonstrates how closures can capture their environment and be used to customize behavior based on that captured context.
