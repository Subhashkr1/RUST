# Processing a Series of Items with Iterators

The iterator pattern allows processing items sequentially without manually implementing iteration logic. Iterators in Rust are **lazy**, meaning they donâ€™t execute until a method consuming the iterator is called.

## Creating an Iterator

To create an iterator, use the `iter` method on a collection:

```rust
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
let v1_iter = v1.iter();
```

This stores an iterator in `v1_iter`, but it does nothing until consumed.

## Using an Iterator in a Loop

```rust
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
let v1_iter = v1.iter();

for val in v1_iter {
    println!("Got: {val}");
}
```

## The Iterator Trait and `next` Method

The `Iterator` trait defines the `next` method, which returns items sequentially:

```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}
```

Example of calling `next` manually:

```rust
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
let mut v1_iter = v1.iter();

assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&1));
assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&2));
assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&3));
assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), None);
```

## Consuming Iterators

Some methods consume the iterator, such as `sum`:

```rust
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
let v1_iter = v1.iter();
let total: i32 = v1_iter.sum();
assert_eq!(total, 6);
```

## Transforming Iterators

Iterator adapters like `map` return modified iterators:

```rust
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
let v2: Vec<_> = v1.iter().map(|x| x + 1).collect();
assert_eq!(v2, vec![2, 3, 4]);
```

## Filtering with Closures

Closures allow capturing environment variables in iterator adapters like `filter`:

```rust
struct Shoe {
    size: u32,
    style: String,
}

fn shoes_in_size(shoes: Vec<Shoe>, shoe_size: u32) -> Vec<Shoe> {
    shoes.into_iter().filter(|s| s.size == shoe_size).collect()
}
```

Iterators simplify working with sequences, reduce repetitive code, and enhance flexibility. For more details, refer to the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-02-iterators.html).
